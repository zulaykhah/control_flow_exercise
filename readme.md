## List the symbols for the following javaScript operators:
- Arithmetic operators: addition (+), substraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)

- Assignment operators: equality sign (=)
- Comparison operators: greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equals to (>=), less than or equals to (<=), equality sign (==), strict equality sign (===), not equal to (!=), 
- strictly not equal to (!==)
- Logical operators: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)
- Bitwise operators: 
- i. AND (&)
- ii. OR (|)
- iii. XOR (^)
- iv. NOT (~)
- v. zero fill left shift (<<)
- vi. signed right shift (>>)
- vii. zero fill right shift (>>>)

## For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples:
- Arithmetic operators: 
- i. Addition
-    let x = 10;
-    let y = 5;
-    let z = x + y;
-    console.log(z);
- ii. Multiplication
-     let a = 20;
-     let b = 5;
-     let c = a * b;
-     console.log(c);
- Assignment operator:
- i. let x = 5;
- ii.   x = x + 5;
-     console.log(x);
- Comparison operator:
- i. greater than
-    let a = 3;
-    let b = 2;
-    console.log(a > b);
- ii. strict equality
-     let apples = 5;
-     let oranges = '5';
-     console.log(5 === '5');
- Logical operators:
- i. AND (&&):
-    let eat = 'true';
-    let notEating = 'false';
-    let either = eat && notEating;
-    console.log(either);
- ii. OR (||):
-     let eat = 'true';
-     let notEating = 'true';
-     let either = eat || notEating;
-     console.log(either);
- Bitwise operator:
- i. AND: is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1. i.e
- 0 & 0 = 0
- 1 & 0 = 0
- 0 & 1 = 0
- 1 & 1 = 1
- ii. OR: is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if one of the bits is 1. i.e
- 0 | 0 = 0
- 0 | 1 = 1
- 1 | 0 = 1
- 1 | 1 = 1
